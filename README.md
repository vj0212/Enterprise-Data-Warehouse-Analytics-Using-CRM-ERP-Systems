## Data Architecture and Flow

The attached diagrams provide visual context:
- **High-Level Architecture (Image 3)**: Data flows from CRM and ERP `.csv` files to:
  - **Bronze Layer**: Raw data tables, batch-loaded with no transformation.
  - **Silver Layer**: Cleansed tables with transformations (e.g., standardization, deduplication).
  - **Gold Layer**: Views forming a star schema, integrating and aggregating data for BI, reporting, SQL queries, and machine learning.
- **Star Schema (Image 2)**: Defines Gold layer tables:
  - `gold.dim_customers`: Customer dimension with `Customer_Key`.
  - `gold.dim_products`: Product dimension with `Product_Key`.
  - `gold.fact_sales`: Sales fact table linked via `Customer_Key` and `Product_Key`.
- **Data Flow Diagram (Image 4)**: Maps specific tables from CRM and ERP to Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **Star Schema** with Dimension & Fact tables

### ðŸ§± Data Model
- **Star schema**: `dim_customers`, `dim_products`, `fact_sales`
- **Snowflake extension**: `Customers_Report` view adds segmentation and behavior insights
- **Relationships**: Based on surrogate keys (`Customer_Key`, `Product_Key`)

### ðŸ“Œ Key Metrics 
```DAX
--(KPI Cards)--

Total Revenue:
Value: â‚¹29.356M (29.356 million)
Metric: Sum of Sales Amount
Insight: This represents the total revenue generated, indicating a significant sales volume.

Total Customers:
Value: 18,484K (18.484 million)
Metric: Count of Customer Key
Insight: A large customer base, suggesting widespread market reach.

Returning Customers:
Value: 7K (7,000) (updated based on DAX: CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT('gold Customers_Report'[Customer_Key]), 'gold Customers_Report'[Lifespan_As_Customers_In_Months] > 1))
Metric: Repeat Customers (defined as customers with a lifespan > 1 month)
Insight: The 7,000 returning customers (0.0378% of 18.484M) reflect those who have stayed with the business for more than one month, indicating a low retention rate or a large influx of one-time buyers.

Average Price of an Order:
Value: â‚¹486.05
Metric: Average Value of Order
Insight: The average order value is moderate, suggesting a mix of low and high-value transactions.

## Dashboard Data Analysis
Customer Segmentation (Donut Chart):
Segments:
New: 14,637 (79.15%)
Regular: 2,215 (11.99%)
VIP: 1,665 (8.94%)
Insight: The majority of customers are new (over 79%), with a smaller proportion of regular and VIP customers. This aligns with the low returning customer rate, as the DAX definition of returning customers (lifespan > 1 month) may overlap with Regular and VIP segments.

Revenue by Customer Segment (Bar Chart):
Segments and Revenue:
New: â‚¹11.09M
VIP: â‚¹10.76M
Regular: â‚¹7.50M
Insight: Despite fewer VIP and Regular customers, they contribute significantly to revenue, with New customers still leading overall. This suggests higher average spending by non-new segments, potentially including the returning customers.
